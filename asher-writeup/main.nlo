\nomenclatureentry{aNN@[{NN}]\begingroup  Neural Network: mathematic concept through which perceptrons are layered together and adjusted with sample data. \nomeqref {0}|nompageref}{1}
\nomenclatureentry{aTF@[{TF}]\begingroup  TensorFlow: a library built by Google for in-house neural network computations and large matrix calculations. Written in C, but most often used via a Python wrapper. \nomeqref {0}|nompageref}{1}
\nomenclatureentry{aKeras@[{Keras}]\begingroup  Library built to run with a backend of Tensorflow or another low-level matrix-multliplecation library. Has higher level abstractions, such that the arcitecture of the neural network can be more consisely built.\nomeqref {0}|nompageref}{1}
